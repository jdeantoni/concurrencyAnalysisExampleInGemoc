# concurrency Analysis Examples In Gemoc

This repo contains two different executable languages, whose behavioral semantics have been defined twice, by using Henshin and by using MoCCML. 

Both approaches exhibit concurrency aspects and these examples show how, in the GEMOC studio, we can use the same concurrency strategies to better understand the concurrency aspects

TODO: quick introductions of the languages and links to Videos.
